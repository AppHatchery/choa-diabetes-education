        <h3>Nutritional Food Groups</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone needs a healthy, balanced diet, whether we have diabetes or
          not.

          <h4 class="primary-blue">Types of food</h4>
          <p>
            You’ve learned in the previous section that rapid acting insulin is
            calculated based on what your blood sugar is pre-meal and how many
            carbs you plan to eat. To better understand how to calculate insulin
            based off carbohydrate consumption, we need to understand which
            foods have carbs and why they are important to our bodies.

          <h4 class="primary-blue">Carbs</h4>
          <p>Raise blood glucose, brain’s preferred source of fuel.</p>

          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong> <br />
            Starches (bread, cereal, crackers, grains, rice, pasta), starchy
            vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, beans), all fruit and fruit
            juices, milk, yogurt, sugary foods (candy, regular soda, jelly,
            syrup), sweets and desserts (cakes, cookies, pies, ice cream)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 class="primary-blue">Fat</h4>
          <p>
            Fat is also used for energy, with some fats healthier than others.
            Fat alone do not directly raise blood sugar.
          </p>

            <img src="food_fat.png" alt="Fats" />
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong> <br />
            Oils, butter, salad dressings, nuts, seeds, mayonnaise, sour cream,
            cream cheese, bacon, sausage, olives, avocados
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 class="primary-blue">Protein</h4>
          <p>
            Used to grow and repair cells in our body. Sometimes used for
            energy. Proteins have little effect on blood sugar and are not used
            in carb count unless breading or carbs are added.
          </p>
          <div class="align-center">
            <img src="food_proteins.png" alt="Proteins" />
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong> <br />
            Beef, pork, chicken, turkey, fish and seafood, eggs, cheese, nuts,
            seeds, and peanut butter
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          When carbohydrates are eaten with protein or fat containing food,
          sharp rise in blood sugar is not seen. Instead, ideal impact in blood
          glucose rise is seen.
