        <h3>Type of food.</h3>
        <p>You’ve learned in the previous section that rapid acting insulin is calculated based on what your blood sugar
            is pre-meal and how many carbs you plan to eat. To better understand how to calculate insulin based off
            carbohydrate consumption, we need to understand which foods have carbs and why they are important to our
            bodies.

                    <b>Carbs</b>—raise blood glucose, brain’s preferred source of fuel.
                    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                        <li>EXAMPLES: starches (bread, cereal, crackers, grains, rice, pasta), starchy vegetables
                            (potatoes, corn, peas, beans),
                            all fruit and fruit juices, milk, yogurt, sugary foods (candy, regular soda, jelly, syrup),
                            sweets and desserts
                            (cakes, cookies, pies, ice cream).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Fat</b>—fat is also used for energy, with some fats healthier than others. Additionally, fats slow absorption of sugars into the blood- therefore are not considered in our carb count.
                    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                        <li>EXAMPLES: oils, butter, salad dressings, nuts, seeds, mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese,
                            bacon, sausage, olives,
                            avocados.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Protein</b>—used to grow and repair cells in our body. Sometimes used for energy. Proteins have
                    little effect on blood sugar and are not used in carb count unless breading or carbs are added.
                    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                        <li>EXAMPLES: beef, pork, chicken, turkey, fish and seafood, eggs, cheese, nuts, seeds, and
                            peanut butter
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When carbohydrates are eaten with protein or fat containing food, sharp rise in blood sugar
                            is not seen. Instead—ideal impact in blood glucose rise is seen.
