        <p>You’ve learned in the previous section that rapid acting insulin is calculated based on what your blood sugar
            is pre-meal and how many carbs you plan to eat. To better understand how to calculate insulin based off
            carbohydrate consumption, we need to understand which foods have carbs and why they are important to our
            bodies.
