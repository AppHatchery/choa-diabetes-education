        <h3>Type of food.</h3>
        <p>
          You’ve learned in the previous section that rapid acting insulin is
          calculated based on what your blood sugar is pre-meal and how many
          carbs you plan to eat. To better understand how to calculate insulin
          based off carbohydrate consumption, we need to understand which foods
          have carbs and why they are important to our bodies.
          <br />
          See <a href="#">food that do/don’t raise blood sugar</a>.

              <b>Carbs</b>—raise blood glucose, brain’s preferred source of
              fuel.
              <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                <li>
                  EXAMPLES: starches (bread, cereal, crackers, grains, rice,
                  pasta), starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, beans), all
                  fruit and fruit juices, milk, yogurt, sugary foods (candy,
                  regular soda, jelly, syrup), sweets and desserts (cakes,
                  cookies, pies, ice cream).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Fat</b>—fat is also used for energy, with some fats healthier
              than others. Additionally, fats slow absorption of sugars into the
              blood- therefore are not considered in our carb count.
              <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                <li>
                  EXAMPLES: oils, butter, salad dressings, nuts, seeds,
                  mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese, bacon, sausage, olives,
                  avocados.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Protein</b>—used to grow and repair cells in our body.
              Sometimes used for energy. Proteins have little effect on blood
              sugar and are not used in carb count unless breading or carbs are
              added.
              <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                <li>
                  EXAMPLES: beef, pork, chicken, turkey, fish and seafood, eggs,
                  cheese, nuts, seeds, and peanut butter
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When carbohydrates are eaten with protein or fat containing
                  food, sharp rise in blood sugar is not seen. Instead—ideal
                  impact in blood glucose rise is seen.
