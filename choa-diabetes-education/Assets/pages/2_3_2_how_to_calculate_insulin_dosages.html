        <h3>How to calculate insulin dosages</h3>

        <div>
          <h4 class="primary-blue">Insulin for food</h4>
          <p>
            Foods with carbohydrates raise blood sugar and need insulin.There
            are two ways we can calculate insulin needed for food, using a carb
            ratio or a set insulin dose. Your diabetes doctor will tell you
            which method you’ll use to understand your insulin dose for food.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 class="primary-blue">Insulin to carbohydrate ratio</h4>
          <p>
            Knowledge of carb counting needed to accurately calculate dose.
            Gives increased flexibility and accuracy to give insulin based on
            child’s normal meal pattern.
          </p>
          <p>Your diabetes doctor will give you the ratio to use</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 unit is given for every ___ grams of carbohydrate in the
              meal/snack
            </li>
            <li>
              Calculate carbs in meal and divide by ratio, see example below
            </li>
            <li>
              1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate for this meal = 3 units
              of rapid acting insulin
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, if a child is eating 30 grams of carbohydrate, you will
            take 30/10 = 3 units of rapid acting insulin.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 class="primary-blue">Set insulin dose for meals</h4>
          <p>
            Foods with carbohydrates raise blood sugar and need insulin.There
            are two ways we can calculate insulin needed for food, using a carb
            ratio or a set insulin dose. Your diabetes doctor will tell you
            which method you’ll use to understand your insulin dose for food.
          </p>
          <p>Some children take set doses of insulin for meals.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your diabetes doctor will let you know how many units of insulin
              to take with each meal
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes the amount depends on size of meal (small meal, medium
              meal, etc.) or the amount of carbohydrates you are consuming
            </li>
            <li>
              The set dose is the same each time you eat that particular size
              meal
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Example: if set dose is 6 units for medium meal, you always give 6
            units each time you eat that size meal
          </p>
