        <p>There are two types of insulin commonly used to treat diabetes—rapid acting insulin and long acting insulin.
            Long acting insulin is given once a day at the same time each day.
            Rapid acting insulin is given with meals and to correct high blood sugars.</p>

            <li>Important to take once a day at the same time each day, regardless of what your current blood sugar
                is.

        <p>Your diabetes doctor will prescribe a dose that remains the same each day unless your diabetes doctor tells

        <h3>Storage of Insulin.</h3>
        <p>It is very important for insulin to be stored properly. If not, it may not work as it is supposed to.</p>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>Unopened insulin should be stored in the fridge and is good until the expiration date on the box as long
                as it is unopened.
            </li>
            <li>Always check the expiration date on the vial or pen before you use it. Throw it away if it is expired.
            </li>
            <li>Once a vial or a pen of insulin is opened, it is good for 28 days at room temperature</li>
            <li>It can be helpful to label an insulin pen or vial with the date you opened it with a sharpie</li>
            <li>Once it expires, throw it away</li>
            <li>Store the insulin the way the manufacturer’s instructions tell you to do so or as advised by your
                doctor. Ask your diabetes team about the storage rules for insulin pumps and pens.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Injection Sites</h3>
        <p>Rotation</p>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>Sites to give insulin include abdomen, buttocks, arms, and thighs.</li>
            <li>Change the site where you give the shots each time.</li>
            <li>Make up a chart or a simple system to keep track of the different places you use.
                For instance, you may want to use your right arm for breakfast insulin, your left arm for lunch insulin,
                your stomach for dinner and your buttock for bedtime.
            </li>
            <li>Rotate places within each site. If not, your body might make scar tissue, or lumps, under the skin.
                The scarring can keep insulin from being absorbed well.
            </li>
