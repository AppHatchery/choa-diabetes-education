            you including your blood sugar meter, fast acting carbohydrates and
            glucagon emergency kit

            The causes of a low blood sugar include too much insulin, not eating

        <h3>How to treat low blood sugar</h3>
        <p>
          When blood sugar is under 70mg/dL (for youngers kids less than 6 years
          treat if blood sugar is 80 and below), you need to consume rapid
          acting carbohydrates to raise blood sugars
        </p>

        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
          <li>
            Treat with 15 grams of rapid acting carbohydrates (examples: 4oz
            juice, ½ can of regular soda, glucose tabs, gel)
            <br />
            <!--                <span><a href="#">See food list</a></span></li>-->
          </li>

          <li>
            Recheck blood sugar in 15 minutes- even if your child feels better
          </li>
          <li>
            Eat another 15 grams of rapid acting carbohydrate if blood sugar is
            still not above 70
          </li>
          <li>If the blood sugar is above 70, resume you regular routine</li>
          <li>
            If after 3 checks your blood sugar level is still below 70, call
            your doctor
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Glucagon</h3>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
          <li>
            Used ONLY for severe low blood sugar leading to loss of
            consciousness or seizure
          </li>
          <li>
            Glucagon isn’t something that is used often, so it’s important to
            check the expiration of the glucagon you keep in your home and get a
            new prescription every 12 months to ensure it is within expiration
            date
          </li>
          <li>
            Natural hormone that signals liver to release sugar into the blood
            stream<br />

            ALWAYS turn your child on their side and call 911 after glucagon is
            given. Call your provider's office after the blood sugar has risen
            and your child is safe, so your care team can review blood sugars
            and make insulin adjustments as needed
