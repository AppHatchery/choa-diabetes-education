        <h3>How to treat low blood sugar</h3>
        <p>When blood sugar is under 70mg/dL (for youngers kids less than 6 years treat if blood sugar is 80 and below), you need to
            consume rapid acting
            carbohydrates to raise blood sugars
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li>Treat with 15 grams of rapid acting carbohydrates (examples: 4oz juice, ½ can of
                regular soda, glucose
                tabs, gel)
                <br>
<!--                <span><a href="#">See food list</a></span></li>-->
            <li>Recheck blood sugar in 15 minutes- even if your child feels better</li>
            <li>Eat another 15 grams of rapid acting carbohydrate if blood sugar is still not above
                70
            </li>
            <li>If the blood sugar is above 70, resume you regular routine</li>
            <li>If after 3 checks your blood sugar level is still below 70, call your doctor</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Glucagon</h3>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li> Used ONLY for severe low blood sugar leading to loss of consciousness or seizure
            </li>
            <li> Glucagon isn’t something that is used often, so it’s important to check the
                expiration of the glucagon
                you keep in your home and get a new prescription every 12 months to ensure it is
                within expiration date
            </li>
            <li>Natural hormone that signals liver to release sugar into the blood stream<br>

            <li>ALWAYS turn your child on their side and call 911 after glucagon is given. Call your provider's office after the blood sugar has risen and your child is safe, so your care team can review blood sugars and make insulin adjustments as needed
