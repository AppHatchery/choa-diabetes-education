        <h3>Long-acting insulin</h3>
        <p>Long-acting insulin (Lantus/Levemir/Basaglar/Tresiba/Semglee)- It is a set dose prescribed by your care team.
            The same dose of this insulin is given at the same time, every day regardless of what blood sugar is. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Rapid-acting insulin</h3>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>Rapid acting insulin (Humalog/Novolog/Ademelog/Fiasp)- needs to be calculated whenever your child eats
                carbohydrates and when blood sugar is elevated at meal time.
            </li>
            <li>We need rapid acting insulin for two reasons, carbohydrates and to correct a high blood sugar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Insulin for food</h5>
        <p>Foods with carbohydrates raise blood sugar and need insulin.
            There are two ways we can calculate insulin needed for food, using a carb ratio or a set insulin dose.
            Your diabetes doctor will tell you which method you’ll use to understand your insulin dose for food.</P>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li><h5>Insulin to carbohydrate ratio</h5>
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Knowledge of carb counting needed to accurately calculate dose.</li>
                    <li>Gives increased flexibility and accuracy to give insulin based on child’s normal meal pattern
                    </li>
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will give you the ratio to use:
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
                            <li>1 unit is given for every ___ grams of carbohydrate in the meal/snack</li>
                            <li>Calculate carbs in meal and divide by ratio, see example below</li>
                            <li>1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate for this meal= 3 units of rapid acting
                                insulin. For example, if a child is eating 30 grams of carbohydrate, you will take
                                30/10= 3 units of rapid acting insulin.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Set insulin dose for meals</h5>
                <p>Some children take set doses of insulin for meals.</p>
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will let you know how many units of insulin to take with each meal</li>
                    <li>Sometimes the amount depends on size of meal (small meal, medium meal, etc.)</li>
                    <li>The set dose is the same each time you eat that particular size meal</li>
                    <li>Example: if set dose is 6 units for medium meal, you always give 6 units each time you eat that
                        size meal
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h5>Insulin for blood sugar</h5>
        <p>There are two ways insulin can be calculated to correct for high blood sugar—correction factor/insulin
            sensitivity and sliding scale.
            Your diabetes doctor will tell you which way is best for your family.</p>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li><h5>Calculating correction dose based on correction formula and insulin sensitivity factor:</h5>
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Gives most precise dosing for high blood sugars</li>
                    <li>Use for high blood sugars. Child’s diabetes doctor will set the blood sugar level where
                        correction dosing needs to be given
                    </li>
                    <li>If pre-meal blood sugar(BS) is over 150, take the BS reading and subtract target blood sugar of 100. Next, divide what is left by the correction factor. This calculation will give the units of insulin needed to correct high blood sugar

                    </li>
                    <li>Example: for blood sugar over 150, use formula (BG-100)/50
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
                            <li>Blood sugar is 300</li>
                            <li>(300-100) =200</li>
                            <li>200/50= 4 units. Child is to take 4 units IN ADDITION to meal dose for high blood sugar
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Use for high blood sugars</li>
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will tell you how much insulin to take for specific blood sugar ranges
