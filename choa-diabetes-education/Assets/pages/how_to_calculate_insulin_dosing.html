        <h3>Long-acting insulin.</h3>
        <p>Long-acting insulin (Lantus/Levemir/Basaglar/Triseba/Semglee)- It is a set dose prescribed by your care team.
            The same dose of this insulin is given at the same time, every day regardless of what blood sugar is. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Rapid-acting insulin.</h3>
        <p>Rapid acting insulin (Humalog/Novolog/Ademelog/Fiasp)- needs to be calculated whenever your child eats and
            when blood sugar is elevated at meal- time and bedtim.</p>
        <p>We need rapid acting insulin for two reasons—for food and to correct a high blood sugar.</p>

        <h3>Insulin for food.</h3>
        <p>Foods with carbohydrates raise blood sugar and need insulin.There are two ways we can calculate insulin
            needed for food, using a carb ratio or a set insulin dose. Your diabetes doctor will tell you which method
            you’ll use to understand your insulin dose for food.</P>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li>Insulin to carbohydrate ratio:
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Knowledge of carb counting needed to accurately calculate dose.</li>
                    <li>Gives increased flexibility and accuracy to give insulin based on child’s normal meal pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will give you the ratio to use:
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
                            <li>unit of insulin for every ___ grams of carbohydrate in the meal/snack.</li>
                            <li>Calculate carbs in meal and divide by ratio, see example below.</li>
                            <li>Example: Insulin to carbohydrate ratio is 1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate.
                                Child is eating 30 grams of carbohydrate.
                                1.1 unit for every 10 grams of carbohydrate for this meal=3 units of rapid acting
                                insulin.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Set insulin dose for meals.
                <p>Some children take set doses of insulin for meals.</p>
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will let you know how many units of insulin to take with each meal.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes the amount depends on size of meal (small meal, medium meal, etc.)</li>
                    <li> The set dose is the same each time you eat that particular size meal</li>
                    <li>Example: if set dose is 6 units for medium meal, you always give 6 units each time you eat that size meal.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Insulin for blood sugar.</h3>
        <p>There are two ways insulin can be given to bring down a high blood sugar—correction factor/insulin
            sensitivity and sliding scale.
            a.Your diabetes doctor will tell you which way is best for your family.</p>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
            <li>Calculating correction dose based on correction formula and insulin sensitivity factor:
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Gives most precise dosing for high blood sugars.</li>
                    <li>Use for high blood sugars. Child’s diabetes doctor will set the blood sugar level where correction dosing needs to be given.</li>
                    <li>If pre-meal blood sugar(BS) is over 150,take the BS reading and subtract 100. Then Divide whatis left by the correction factor, the result is the insulin needed to correct high BS</li>
                    <li>Example: for blood sugar over 150, use formula (BG-100)/50
                        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-decimal">
                            <li>Blood sugar is 300.</li>
                            <li>(300-100) =200.</li>
                            <li>200/50= 4 units. Child is to take 4 units IN ADDITION to meal dose for high blood sugar
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sliding scale dosing:
                <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                    <li>Use for high blood sugars.</li>
                    <li>Your diabetes doctor will tell you how much insulin to take for specific blood sugar ranges
                        above target.
                    </li>
                    <li>Example:</li>
